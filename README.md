# tsp
Quantitative tool kit for estimating solutions of the Traveling Salesmen Problem.


The goal of this project is to create an infrastructure for estimating solutions of the traveling salesmen problem.  The infrastructure should:
  - allow for a user to easily create an randomly generated city map:
    - using premade algorithums
    - by creating their own map creation algorithm
  - allow for a user to easily apply a tsp solution estimation algorithum to a city map:
    - using premade algorithms
    - by creating their own solution algorithm
  - visualize solutions to previously executed solution algorithms
  - easily apply various solution algorithms to maps created from various map creation algorithms
  - be coded easily enough that a college graduate outside of Computer Science but with a quantative background can understand and contribute.
